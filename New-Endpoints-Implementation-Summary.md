# New Endpoints Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the three new endpoints you requested with comprehensive functionality, proper validation, and detailed response models.

## ✅ Implemented Endpoints

### 1. GET /bookings/provider/{providerId} - Provider Bookings

**Purpose**: Retrieve all bookings for a specific provider with optional filtering

**Features**:
- **Provider Validation**: Ensures the provider exists and is actually a provider
- **Flexible Filtering**: 
  - `status`: Filter by booking status (pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
  - `startDate`: Filter from date (ISO format)
  - `endDate`: Filter until date (ISO format)
- **Rich Response**: Returns `BookingWithDetails` with nested service, client, and business information
- **Authorization**: Requires JWT token
- **Sorting**: Results sorted by start time (newest first)

**Request Examples**:
```http
GET /bookings/provider/provider-123
GET /bookings/provider/provider-123?status=pending
GET /bookings/provider/provider-123?startDate=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-12-31T23:59:59Z

## ✅ Technical Implementation

### New DTOs Created
1. **BookingWithDetails**: Enhanced booking with nested service, client, and business details
2. **ServiceDetails**: Service information subset for nested responses
3. **ClientDetails**: Client information subset for nested responses  
4. **BusinessDetails**: Business information subset for nested responses
5. **DashboardStats**: Comprehensive provider statistics
6. **CityInfo**: Geographic and service availability information

### New Queries and Handlers
1. **GetProviderBookingsQuery/Handler**: Retrieves and filters provider bookings
2. **GetProviderDashboardStatsQuery/Handler**: Calculates provider statistics
3. **GetAvailableCitiesQuery/Handler**: Aggregates city and service data

### Repository Enhancements
1. **IBookingRepository.GetBookingsByProviderAsync()**: New method to get all bookings for a provider
2. **IBusinessRepository.GetAllAsync()**: New method to get all businesses for city aggregation
3. **BookingRepository**: Implemented provider booking retrieval
4. **BusinessRepository**: Implemented get all businesses functionality

### New Controllers
1. **DashboardController**: Provider analytics and statistics
2. **LocationsController**: Geographic and location-based data
3. **BookingsController**: Enhanced with provider bookings endpoint

## ✅ Security & Validation

### Authentication & Authorization
- All provider-specific endpoints require JWT authentication
- Provider validation ensures only actual providers can access provider data
- User type validation prevents clients from accessing provider endpoints

### Input Validation
- Provider ID validation (exists and is provider type)
- Date range validation for booking filters
- Status validation for booking filters

### Error Handling
- **404 Not Found**: When provider doesn't exist
- **400 Bad Request**: When provider is not actually a provider type
- **401 Unauthorized**: When JWT token is missing or invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: When user doesn't have required permissions

## ✅ Performance Considerations

### Efficient Data Retrieval
- Single repository calls where possible
- In-memory filtering for complex date/status queries (DynamoDB limitation)
- Lazy loading of related entities only when needed

### Caching Opportunities
- City data could be cached (changes infrequently)
- Dashboard stats could be cached with short TTL
- Provider booking lists could be cached per provider

## ✅ API Documentation

### Swagger Integration
- Comprehensive XML documentation for all endpoints
- Detailed parameter descriptions
- Response schema documentation
- Error response documentation
- Authorization requirements clearly marked

### HTTP Status Codes
- **200 OK**: Successful data retrieval
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters or validation errors
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid JWT token
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server errors
