# New Endpoints Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented two new endpoints for the BookSpot API to enhance service discovery and business management capabilities.

## New Endpoints

### 1. GET /services/search
**Purpose**: Advanced service search with multiple filter options and pagination

**Features**:
- **Name Filter**: Search services by name (partial match, case-insensitive)
- **City Filter**: Filter services by business location (partial match, case-insensitive)
- **Price Range**: Filter by minimum and maximum price
- **Duration Range**: Filter by service duration in minutes
- **Pagination**: Support for page-based navigation with configurable page size

**Query Parameters**:
```
GET /services/search?name=massage&city=new%20york&minPrice=50&maxPrice=100&minDuration=60&maxDuration=120&page=1&pageSize=10
```

**Example Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "service-123",
    "businessId": "business-456",
    "name": "Deep Tissue Massage",
    "price": 85.50,
    "durationMinutes": 90,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

### 2. GET /businesses/{id}/services
**Purpose**: Retrieve all services offered by a specific business

**Features**:
- **Business Validation**: Ensures the business exists before returning services
- **Complete Service List**: Returns all services associated with the business
- **Error Handling**: Proper 404 response if business doesn't exist

**Example Request**:
```
GET /businesses/business-123/services
```

**Example Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "service-123",
    "businessId": "business-123",
    "name": "Deep Tissue Massage",
    "price": 85.50,
    "durationMinutes": 90,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "service-124",
    "businessId": "business-123",
    "name": "Swedish Massage",
    "price": 75.00,
    "durationMinutes": 60,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T11:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Implementation Details

### Application Layer
**New Query Classes**:
1. `SearchServicesQuery` - Handles service search with filters and pagination
2. `SearchServicesHandler` - Implements the search logic with in-memory filtering
3. `GetServicesByBusinessQuery` - Retrieves services for a specific business
4. `GetServicesByBusinessHandler` - Implements business service lookup with validation

### API Layer
**Enhanced Controllers**:
1. **ServicesController**: Added comprehensive XML documentation and the new search endpoint
2. **BusinessesController**: Added the services endpoint with proper documentation

### Swagger Documentation
**Enhanced Features**:
- Detailed XML comments for all endpoints
- Comprehensive parameter descriptions
- Response type specifications
- Error response documentation
- Updated operation filters for better API documentation

## Search Functionality

### Filter Capabilities
- **Text Search**: Case-insensitive partial matching for service names
- **Location Search**: City-based filtering through business lookup
- **Price Range**: Flexible minimum and maximum price filtering
- **Duration Range**: Filter by service duration for time-conscious clients
- **Pagination**: Efficient data retrieval with configurable page sizes

### Performance Considerations
- **Current Implementation**: In-memory filtering (suitable for moderate datasets)
- **Future Enhancement**: Database-level filtering for better performance at scale
- **Pagination Limits**: Maximum 100 items per page to prevent performance issues

## Business Rules Enforced

### Search Endpoint
- Page number defaults to 1 if invalid
- Page size capped at 100 items maximum
- All filters are optional and can be combined
- Empty results return valid empty array

### Business Services Endpoint
- Business existence validation before service lookup
- Proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Returns empty array if business has no services

## Error Handling

### Search Endpoint
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid search parameters
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server errors

### Business Services Endpoint
- **404 Not Found**: Business doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server errors

## Usage Examples

### Finding Massage Services in New York
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/services/search?name=massage&city=new%20york&minPrice=50&maxPrice=150"
```

### Getting All Services from a Specific Business
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/businesses/business-123/services"
```

### Paginated Search Results
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/services/search?page=2&pageSize=5"
```

## Future Enhancements

### Database Optimization
1. **Indexed Search**: Add database indexes for common search fields
2. **Full-Text Search**: Implement advanced text search capabilities
3. **Geolocation**: Add distance-based search for nearby services
4. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently searched terms

### Advanced Filtering
1. **Category Filtering**: Add service categories/tags
2. **Availability Filtering**: Show only services with available time slots
3. **Rating Filtering**: Filter by average service ratings
4. **Business Hours**: Filter by services available at specific times

### Performance Improvements
1. **Database-Level Filtering**: Move filtering logic to database queries
2. **Elasticsearch Integration**: Advanced search capabilities
3. **Response Caching**: Cache search results for common queries
4. **Lazy Loading**: Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets

## Testing the New Endpoints

### Running the Application
1. Build the project: `dotnet build`
2. Run the API: `dotnet run --project BookSpot.API`
3. Access Swagger UI: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

### Testing Search Functionality
1. Navigate to the Services section in Swagger UI
2. Try the `/services/search` endpoint with various filter combinations
3. Test pagination with different page sizes

### Testing Business Services
1. First create a business using the `/businesses` POST endpoint
2. Create services for that business using `/services` POST endpoint
3. Use the `/businesses/{id}/services` endpoint to retrieve all services

The new endpoints significantly enhance the BookSpot API's service discovery capabilities, making it easier for clients to find relevant services and for the system to provide organized service listings by business.
